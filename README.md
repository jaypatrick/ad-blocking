# Welcome to my ad-blocking repository
Various rules lists, scripts, and other goodies I use to block nuisances from my network
## Project purpose
The internet is full of nuisances, and I've been on a quest to eradicate them from my network for decades.
1. Ads
2. Trackers
3. Malware
### How do I safeguard my network?
There are plenty of great apps that will help, but my experience is that there is no ==one size fits all== solution, especially for those of us on a domain, as well as those of us who have Internet of Things devices like:
- Echoes, HomePods, and other smart devices
- Smart TV's
- Anything else that doesn't have a UI within which to facilitate installation of blocking software
#### Sounds like a lot of work!
It is, which is why I've done all the hard work for you. So, how do I get to blocking ads? First, check out these links to see how you measure up:
