# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that describes completed migrations, refactorings, and implementation phases. These documents are kept for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Archived Documents

### Migration & Restructuring Summaries
- **RESTRUCTURING_SUMMARY.md** - Repository structure improvements (2024)
- **centralized-package-migration-summary.md** - .NET package management centralization
- **RUST_MODERNIZATION_SUMMARY.md** - Rust workspace unification
- **ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_MIGRATION.md** - Environment variable standardization
- **TEST_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md** - .NET test suite updates

### Implementation Tracking
- **PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Shell reorganization and environment variables (completed)
- **oop-refactoring-next-steps.md** - PowerShell OOP refactoring plan

## Why Archive?

These documents described work that has been completed and integrated into the main codebase. While they provide valuable historical context, they are no longer needed for day-to-day development:

- The restructuring is complete and reflected in the current repository structure
- Migration guides are no longer needed as the migrations are complete
- Implementation tracking documents served their purpose during active development
