# Bun configuration for ad-blocking-website (Gatsby)
# https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/bunfig
#
# Note: Gatsby has experimental Bun support. This repo uses Bun-based scripts
# (e.g., `bun install` / `bunx --bun gatsby`) experimentally; if you hit issues,
# you can fall back to running Gatsby commands via npm/npx.

# Use exact versions for reproducible builds
exact = true

# Gatsby may have issues with some hoisting
