The Ad-Blocking Repository is a comprehensive multi-language toolkit for ad-blocking, network protection, and AdGuard DNS management. This project provides filter rule compilers implemented in four different languages (TypeScript, .NET, Python, and Rust), giving developers the flexibility to choose their preferred language and runtime environment.

Each compiler wraps the powerful @adguard/hostlist-compiler and supports all 11 transformations, multi-format configurations (JSON, YAML, TOML), and advanced pattern matching. The repository also includes a complete C# SDK for the AdGuard DNS API v1.11 with Polly resilience policies, an interactive Spectre.Console UI for DNS management, and automation scripts in PowerShell and Bash.

Whether you're managing network-wide ad-blocking, compiling custom filter lists, or integrating with AdGuard DNS, this repository provides production-ready tools with comprehensive testing and CI/CD integration. All components are cross-platform, well-documented, and actively maintained.
